🚀 Just built an AI-powered Coding Agent using LangGraph + Groq + Tavily + Gradio! 🤖💡

 fully functional AI agent that can:
🔍 Search real-time information using Tavily Web Search
🧠 Reason through complex prompts using LangGraph
🧾 Write and execute Python code via PythonREPLTool
🦙 Powered by LLaMA3-70B via Groq for lightning-fast generation
💬 Wrapped in a sleek Gradio interface for interactive chat

🛠️ Example use case:

“Where is sliding window used in the real world? Write code for a relevant use case.”

💥 The agent dynamically searches, thinks, and codes in seconds!

This project helped me dive deeper into:

LangGraph's multi-agent flow design

Tool-based reasoning (ReAct paradigm)

Groq's blazing-fast inference

Creating production-friendly UIs with Gradio

🧩 Tech Stack:
LangGraph, Groq LLaMA3-70B, Tavily, LangChain, PythonREPLTool, Gradio

📌Why This Matters
✅ Combines information retrieval + reasoning + execution in one loop
✅ Built for tasks like:

Quick prototyping of code from queries

AI-assisted research & exploration

Future potential: multi-agent workflows for research & data analysis
